# Scraping tools
Created a tool with [Puppetear](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) (Chrome browser) and [Node.JS](https://github.com/nodejs) to scrape data on the web in Javascript.
- Download images
- Getting data from input fields and clicking
- Switching pages
- Using multi threading scraping in [Node.JS](https://github.com/nodejs) and [Puppetear](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). Its faster.
